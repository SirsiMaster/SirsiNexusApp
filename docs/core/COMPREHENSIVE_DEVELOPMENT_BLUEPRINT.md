**Last Updated:** 2025-07-11  
**Status:** PHASE 7.5 SIRSI-CENTRIC IMPLEMENTATION - Corrected Architecture

## üéØ ARCHITECTURAL CLARIFICATION: SIRSI-CENTRIC COMMUNICATION

**CORE PRINCIPLE**: Sirsi Persona is the ONLY user interface. All agent interactions flow through her omnipresent consciousness.

**Communication Flow Reality:**
```
User ‚Üê ‚Üí Sirsi Persona ‚Üê ‚Üí Domain Agents
```

**ARCHITECTURAL REQUIREMENTS:**
- ‚úÖ **Sirsi Hypervisor**: Central orchestrating intelligence managing all agent communication
- ‚úÖ **Omnipresent Sirsi Persona**: Embedded in every UI context as the single interface
- ‚úÖ **Agent-to-Sirsi Protocol**: Internal communication channels (agents NEVER talk to UI directly)
- ‚úÖ **Knowledge Synthesis**: Sirsi processes agent responses for user presentation
- ‚úÖ **Context Management**: Sirsi maintains conversation context across all interactions
- ‚úÖ **Unified Intelligence**: Sirsi orchestrates multi-agent responses seamlessly

A dense, end-to-end specification for a production-ready, agent-embedded migration orchestration platform.

## 1. Executive Summary

**Goal**: Ship _SirsiNexus_‚Äîthe world's first **Generative AI Infrastructure Assistant** that transforms how teams build, deploy, and manage cloud infrastructure. Through natural language conversations, Sirsi generates complete infrastructure solutions, autonomously manages deployments, and provides intelligent optimization recommendations. The platform combines LLM-powered agents with deep domain expertise, Hedera DLT knowledge graphs, and MCP protocol communication, creating an omnipresent AI assistant that understands context and provides intelligent guidance across every infrastructure interaction.

**Core Architecture**:
- ü§ñ **Sirsi Hypervisor**: Central orchestrating intelligence managing entire platform
- üß† **LLM-Based Agents**: GPT-4/Claude-powered domain specialists with conversational AI
- üîó **MCP Integration**: Model Context Protocol for standardized agent communication  
- üåê **Hedera Knowledge Graph**: Distributed knowledge management on Hedera DLT
- ‚òÅÔ∏è **Multi-Cloud Infrastructure**: Complete AWS, Azure, GCP integration and orchestration
- üí° **Sirsi Persona**: Omnipresent AI consciousness embedded in every UI context

**Strategic Partnerships**:
- **NVIDIA Inception Program**: 3-year member with access to cutting-edge AI/ML resources, GPU computing, and technical expertise
- **AWS Migration Acceleration Program (MAP)**: Official partner providing migration funding, technical support, and go-to-market resources

**Key Pillars**:

1. **Generative AI-First**: Every infrastructure operation begins with natural language. Users describe their needs, and Sirsi generates complete solutions‚Äîfrom architecture diagrams to deployment scripts. The AI understands context, suggests optimizations, and learns from every interaction.
2. **Conversational Infrastructure**: Replace complex configuration files and CLIs with natural conversations. "Deploy a scalable web application with auto-scaling" becomes a simple chat message that generates everything needed.
3. **Intelligent Domain Agents**: Specialized LLM-powered agents with deep expertise in AWS, Azure, GCP, security, networking, and DevOps. Each agent understands best practices and can explain decisions in plain language.
4. **Autonomous Operations**: Self-healing infrastructure that predicts issues, automatically applies fixes, and continuously optimizes for cost and performance without human intervention.
5. **Security & Compliance by Design**: Zero trust using mTLS and SPIFFE for identity, dynamic secrets via HashiCorp Vault, policy-as-code enforced by OPA at both CI and runtime, and runtime sandboxing of untrusted code modules via gVisor and eBPF-based anomaly detection.
6. **Scalable, Resilient Infrastructure**: Kubernetes Operators to manage migration CRDs, auto-scaling via HPA and custom metrics, multi-region disaster recovery with etcd replication and cross-region object storage, and event-driven workflows for high throughput.
7. **Enterprise-Grade CI/CD & Testing**: Comprehensive GitHub Actions/Azure Pipelines setup for linting (Clippy, ESLint, GoLint), unit tests (Rust, Go, Python, Jest), integration tests (Testcontainers, KIND), end-to-end UI tests (Cypress), security scans (Snyk, Trivy), and performance baselining (K6, Lighthouse).

```

**Contracts**: All services share versioned proto definitions under `core-engine/proto/*.proto`. Events adhere to schemas in `pipeline/schemas/`.

### 4.1 GUI-First Development Approach

To keep the interface "alive" during early development, the project begins by scaffolding the entire UI and CLI with mocked data. Every screen, modal and dashboard is implemented first, then real services and sub-agents replace the placeholders incrementally. This approach validates workflows early and guides backend priorities.

## 11. Enhanced Migration Framework

### 11.1 Architecture Overview

The enhanced migration framework within Sirsi Nexus provides an end-to-end, agent-assisted migration flow. It is engineered to support complex, multi-cloud environments with dynamic adjustments based on the selected source and destination platforms.

#### Core Components:

1. **Secure Communication Protocols**: Using mTLS, HTTPS, SFTP, or SSH for all communication to ensure data security and integrity.

2. **Dynamic Workflow Exhibition**: Adapts migration steps dynamically based on real-time analysis of source and destination environments, leveraging intelligent agents for AWS, Azure, and GCP.

3. **Backup and Disaster Recovery**: Incorporates pre-migration backup and checkpoints during the migration to allow error rollback and post-migration validation.

4. **CI/CD Integration**: Supports deployment and management using tools such as Azure Migrate, Bicep, Terraform, Ansible, and Pulumi for infrastructure as code.

5. **User Agreement Process**: Provides users with a detailed proposed migration plan, including checkboxes for acknowledgment, edits, or disagreement.

### 11.2 Detailed Migration Process

#### Step 1: Environment Discovery
- **Protocols**: Agents perform secure discovery over mTLS or HTTPS.
- **Parameters**: Gather details on assets, IPs, devices, users, policies.
- **Tools**: Use native cloud provider APIs, in addition to third-party discovery tools.

#### Step 2: User Agreement Proposal
- **Presentation**: Render a detailed migration plan with all identified elements displayed for user review and agreement.
- **User Actions**: Checkboxes are provided for user agreement, requests for modification, or rejection.

#### Step 3: Migration Planning
- **Agents Involved**: AWS and Azure agents interact to bridge platform-specific requirements and rubrics.
- **CI/CD Tools**: Prepare IaC models using Terraform, Bicep, Ansible.
- **Secure Protocols**: Continue using only mTLS or HTTPS for communication.

#### Step 4: Execution and Monitoring
- **Procedures**: Execute plan with continuous monitoring and real-time reports via secure WebSockets to user interface.
- **Error Handling**: Implement step-level rollback and recovery options.
- **Tools Integration**: Automated checks with CI/CD for verification through tools like Testcontainers.

#### Step 5: Validation and Optimization
- **Post-Migration Checks**: Validate all transferred resources; apply performance tuning and optimization strategies.
- **Logging and Audit**: Every action, error, communication between components is logged.
- **Reports**: Produce detailed post-migration audit reports, including security and compliance status.

### 11.3 Audit and Logging Framework
- **Logged Details**: IP, asset, user, device details collected during the discovery phase.
- **Communication Logs**: Record each inter-agent communication, including timestamps, involved agents, and used protocols.
- **Error Logging**: Capture every step that encountered an issue, including automatic remediation attempts.
