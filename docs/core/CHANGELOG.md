## [0.8.1-alpha] - 2026-03-05

### 🎨 UNIVERSAL DARK/LIGHT THEME PARITY (Tasks 1-6/40)

#### Portal Pages — Complete Text Color Purge (19 pages, Tasks 1-5)
- **settings.tsx**: Removed phantom classes (`glass-panel`, `gold-border`, `action-btn`) → canonical `sirsi-card`, `btn-primary`, `sirsi-badge`
- **ai-agents.tsx**: 15 hardcoded colors → Tailwind `dark:` variants
- **committee.tsx**: 8 hardcoded colors → theme-aware (date badges, titles, chevron)
- **data-room.tsx**: 12 hardcoded colors → theme-aware (filter bar, search, table)
- **api-server.tsx**: Migrated to `sirsi-table-wrap`/`sirsi-table` canonical classes
- **backup-status.tsx**: Stat labels, progress bars, select, table, action buttons
- **cache-status.tsx**: Distribution bars, perf metrics grid, select, table
- **client-portal.tsx**: 1 heading color
- **console.tsx**: Context hints only (terminal interior intentionally dark)
- **database-health.tsx**: Connection labels, status badges, progress bars, table
- **security.tsx**: 29 hardcoded instances — metrics, sessions, rules, whitelist, audit
- **investor-portal.tsx**: KPI banner, data room taxonomy, compliance footer
- **kpi-metrics.tsx**: Stat labels, chart descriptions
- **messaging.tsx**: Chat UI, message bubbles, sender names
- **monitoring.tsx**: Uptime bars, alert cards, metric labels
- **portal.tsx**: Data room taxonomy heading
- **site-admin.tsx**: SVG gauge labels, service grid, audit trail
- **system-logs.tsx**: Filter labels, log entries, pagination
- **telemetry.tsx**: Heatmap, funnel, timeline

#### Task 6: Complete Dark Mode Parity — Backgrounds, Borders, Inputs, Buttons (10 files, `6e05b73`)
- **analytics.tsx**: Tab bar bg (`bg-black/[0.04] dark:bg-white/[0.06]`), active tab uses `var(--color-background)`, metric card icon container (`bg-slate-100 dark:bg-slate-700`), all heading colors → `text-foreground`, metric values/labels/subs → `text-foreground`/`text-muted-foreground`
- **messaging.tsx**: Full chat UI theme parity — thread sidebar bg/borders, search input, active thread indicator, chat pane bg, session header avatar, received message bubbles, compose bar
- **monitoring.tsx**: Inactive tab bg removed, log header bg/border, search input, export button, error bar inactive color
- **system-logs.tsx**: Stat cards, filter panel, ALL form inputs (selects, date pickers, search), action buttons (pause/clear/refresh), log container bg, log entry borders, export footer border, 3 export buttons
- **telemetry.tsx**: Heatmap placeholder bg, user journey step pills, timeline connector line, drop-off path pills
- **security.tsx**: Firewall rule names/descriptions, audit ledger heading, IP input border override fix
- **site-admin.tsx**: Service icon containers → `bg-emerald-50 dark:bg-emerald-900/30`
- **kpi-metrics.tsx**: KPI code badge icon container theme-aware
- **backup-status.tsx**: Table header border → className
- **console.tsx**: Header title + purge button → `text-muted-foreground`

#### Admin Header Dark Mode
- Version badge: `isDark`-conditional colors (light: `#64748b`/`#f1f5f9`, dark: `#94a3b8`/`#1e293b`)
- "Live" text: `isDark`-conditional color

#### CSS Framework Additions (`index.css`)
- `.dark .admin-header-search input` — dark background/border/text
- `.dark .admin-header-search-icon` — muted color in dark mode
- `.dark .admin-header-search-kbd` — dark background for keyboard shortcut
- `.dark .btn-secondary` — dark border/text/hover states

#### Result
**Zero non-brand hardcoded patterns remain** across all portal pages.
All inline `background`, `border`, `color` patterns replaced with `className` using `dark:` variants
or CSS variables (`var(--color-background)`, `var(--color-border)`, `text-foreground`).

## [0.8.0-alpha] - 2026-03-05

### 🚀 PHASE 5: REACT AS PRIMARY PLATFORM

#### Unified Version Badge System
- Centralized version module (`lib/version.ts`) — reads from `package.json` at build time via Vite `define`
- Public header: Clickable `v0.8.0-alpha` badge → `/changelog`
- Admin header: Matching layout — brand name on line 1, version + Live on line 2
- Both headers read from same `APP_VERSION_DISPLAY` constant

#### New Public Pages (7)
- `/about` — Company info, team, mission, HQ address
- `/blog` — TEDCO investment, DCA Live award, whitepaper previews
- `/pricing` — 3 tiers ($49, $499, $4,999)
- `/privacy` — Full privacy policy
- `/terms` — Terms of service
- `/changelog` — Release timeline with 18 versions (v0.1.0 → v0.8.0-alpha)
- `/documentation` — Platform documentation (existing)

#### Global Text Justification
- `text-align: justify` on `body` — all pages (public + portal) now have clean text blocks
- Headings and centered content override justify via their own text-align rules

#### Architecture Decision
- **ADR-027 Phase 5**: React app becomes sole delivery platform
- HTML admin portal archived as historical reference
- Rule 22 superseded — React IS the source of truth

#### Commits
