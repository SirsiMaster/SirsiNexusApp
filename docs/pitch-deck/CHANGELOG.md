# CHANGELOG

## Phase 1: Setup (Nov 13, 2025)

- **Project initiated**: Family office targeting angle, one universal deck strategy, phased development approach.
- **Workflow established**: `deck` (canonical) ← changes approved from `nov` (working file).
- **Directory cleaned**: Quarantined old deck artifacts (.pptx, .pdf, conversion scripts) to `.trash/` for safety.
- **Documentation created**: `warp.md` (implementation guidelines), `claude.md` (AI assistance guidance), `CHANGELOG.md` (decision log).
- **Working file created**: `sirsipitchdecknov.html` copied from `sirsi-pitch-deck.html`.

## Phase 2: Content Development (Nov 13, 2025)

### Patient Capital Deployment Structure
- New Slide 12 (replaced old Ask): "Patient Capital Deployment Opportunity"
  - Three-round structure: Pre-Seed ($1.5M @ $7M pre-money) → Seed ($6M @ $16M pre-money) → Series A ($12.5M @ $37.5M pre-money)
  - Founder ownership maintained: 82.4% → 72.7% → 60% (lead investor full journey)
  - Total opportunity: $20MM deployment with 12–18 month pacing or all-in to Series A
  - Outcome messaging: "Sirsi thrives independently. Together, we build a rocket ship."

- New Slide 13: "Partnership: Patient Capital Meets Founder Vision"
  - Two-column layout: "What We Bring" (leadership, traction, partnerships) vs. "What You Gain" (board seat, network leverage, long-term alignment)
  - Emphasizes sustainable growth, no extraction pressure, unicorn path (ARR $73M in 5 years), IPO target ~3 years post–Series A (market conditions permitting)

### Integration Approach
- No explicit "family office" language—messaging targets patient, long-term partners universally
- Focus on founder control: 60%+ at full $20MM deployment
- Keep deck universal; embed partnership tone subtly across slides

### Deck Structure Update
- Total slides: 14 (added Partnership slide)
- Slide order: ... → Financials → Investment Opportunity → Partnership Model → Contact

## Phase 3: Institutional Deck Creation (Nov 13, 2025)

- Created `sirsi-pitch-deck-infrastructure.html`: Infrastructure optimization-first narrative for family offices, datacenters, and enterprises
- 12 slides focused on:
  - Problem: 20-40% datacenter compute waste, enterprise overspend
  - Solution: AI infrastructure optimization engine (25-40% cost reduction)
  - Build Layer: Self-service wedge to get workloads onto platform (ChatGPT → LLMOps analogy)
  - Revenue Model: Datacenter partnerships ($2-5M+ annually), enterprise contracts ($500K-2M+), SMB tier
  - GTM: Datacenters first → enterprises → SMB/developer scale
  - Financial Path: $2M Y1 → $73M Y5 unicorn → IPO
  - Patient Capital Structure: Pre-Seed ($1.5M @ $7M pre), Seed ($6M @ $16M pre), Series A ($12.5M @ $37.5M pre), founder 60%+ control at full deployment
  - Partnership Model: Board seat, network leverage, long-term alignment (no extraction)

- Two-Deck Strategy Established:
  - `sirsipitchdecknov.html` + `sirsi-pitch-deck.html` (mass market): Consumer/SMB friendly, "Build apps without infrastructure expertise"
  - `sirsi-pitch-deck-infrastructure.html` (institutional): Datacenter/FO friendly, "Optimize infrastructure at scale"
  - Both decks share core financials ($73M ARR → $1B+ valuation in 5 years)
  - Messaging differs: consumer emphasizes ease, institutional emphasizes margin improvement + moat
  - Target infrastructure profile: Regional/edge datacenters, co-location providers, universities/enterprises ("conversions") monetizing idle capacity
