## REVISED VALUATION ANALYSIS

### Important Distinction: Contracted Revenue vs. Run Rate

The $137K is a **contracted amount** delivered over 4 months, not a monthly run rate. This changes the math:

| Calculation Method | Value | Multiple at $28M Pre | Multiple at $32M Pre |
|--------------------|-------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Total Contracted Revenue** | $147K | — | — |
| **Annualized from Contract Period** | $411K ($34.25K × 12) | 68x | 78x |
| **Including Sept Revenue** | $157K ($10K + $147K) | — | — |
| **Conservative ARR Estimate** | $300-400K | 70-93x | 80-107x |

### The Honest Assessment

At first glance, these multiples look aggressive. **But this is where the momentum factors matter:**

## THE MOMENTUM NARRATIVE

### 🚀 Convergent Factors in Q1 2026

You have **four momentum factors** coming together simultaneously:

### Why This Matters to Investors

**Investors don't just buy revenue—they buy trajectories and narratives.**

| Factor | What It Signals |
|--------|-----------------|
| **TEDCO Public Announcement** | "The State of Maryland is publicly backing this company" |
| **$137K Contract Execution** | "They can sell AND deliver enterprise-grade work" |
| **DCA Live Award** | "The DC tech community has identified them as a leader" |
| **Maintenance Pipeline** | "Revenue converts to recurring—SaaS-like economics" |
| **3 Patents** | "Technical innovation, not just a services wrapper" |

## INVESTOR PERSONA ANALYSIS

### Family Office Perspective ($5-10M Check Writers)

Family offices evaluating Sirsi will consider:

| Question | Sirsi's Answer | Strength |
|----------|---------------|----------|
| "Is this real or hype?" | $147K contracted + TEDCO + DCA Award | ✅ Multiple validation points |
| "Can they execute?" | 4-month contract delivery underway | ✅ Proof in progress |
| "Is there a moat?" | 3 patents pending | ✅ Defensible IP |
| "What's the exit path?" | AI infrastructure → acquisition target | ✅ Hot sector |
| "Is the team credible?" | TEDCO DD + Award recognition | ✅ Third-party vetting |
| "Can I write my check size?" | $12.1M raise fits $5-10M lead | ✅ Right-sized |
| "What's the tax advantage?" | QSBS eligible | ✅ 43% after-tax benefit |

**Family Office Verdict:** This checks all the boxes for a lead position.

## STRATEGIC TIMING RECOMMENDATION

### The TEDCO Announcement is Your Forcing Function

**Scenario A: Raise BEFORE TEDCO announcement**
- Pro: Set terms before market attention
- Con: Miss the PR momentum

**Scenario B: Raise DURING/AFTER TEDCO announcement (RECOMMENDED)**
- Pro: Ride the wave of public validation
- Pro: TEDCO PR creates inbound interest
- Pro: Can reference press in investor decks
- Con: May face more competition for the round

### Recommended Timeline

| Date | Action | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| **Week of Feb 10** | TEDCO announcement goes live | Create market buzz |
| **Feb 10-17** | Share TEDCO press with target family offices | Warm outreach |
| **Feb 17-28** | First meetings with family office leads | Pitch with full momentum story |
| **March 1-15** | Term sheet negotiations | Close lead investor(s) |
| **March 15-31** | Round closure | Complete $12.1M |
| **April+** | Deploy capital, execute on milestones | Build toward next round |

## REVISED VALUATION RECOMMENDATION

Given the momentum factors, here's my revised thinking:

### The Challenge

Pure revenue multiples (70-100x) are aggressive for any stage. You need to justify the valuation with **forward-looking factors**, not just current revenue.

### The Solution: Milestone-Based Valuation

Frame the valuation around **what the $12.1M enables**, not just current revenue:

| Milestone | Timeline | Impact on Valuation |
|-----------|----------|---------------------|
| $137K contract delivered | May 2026 | Execution proof |
| Maintenance contracts live | June 2026 | Recurring revenue established |
| 3 enterprise customers | H2 2026 | Market validation |
| 1 patent granted | H2 2026 | IP moat solidified |
| $1M+ ARR | Q4 2026 | Growth trajectory |

### Recommended Valuation Framing

**Don't say:** "We're raising at 70x revenue"

**Do say:** "We're raising at a $28-32M pre-money valuation that reflects:
1. $147K in contracted revenue with a clear path to $1M+ ARR
2. Institutional backing from TEDCO (State of Maryland)
3. Recognition as a top DC-area AI company (DCA Live Award)
4. 3 patents pending in AI infrastructure
5. A go-to-market strategy that has already landed enterprise contracts"

## FINAL RECOMMENDED TERMS

### Primary Recommendation: $28M Pre-Money

| Term | Value | Rationale |
|------|-------|-----------|
| **Raise** | $12.1M | Per financial model |
| **Pre-Money** | $28M | Defensible with momentum story |
| **Post-Money** | $40.1M | |
| **Dilution** | 30.2% | Acceptable for this raise size |
| **Implied Multiple** | 18x contracted revenue | High, but justified by trajectory |

### Negotiation Range

| Scenario | Pre-Money | Dilution | When to Use |
|----------|-----------|----------|-------------|
| **Aggressive** | $35M | 25.7% | Strong investor competition |
| **Target** | $28M | 30.2% | Standard negotiation |
| **Floor** | $22M | 35.5% | If pushed hard; still acceptable |
| **Walk-Away** | <$18M | >40% | Unacceptable dilution |
