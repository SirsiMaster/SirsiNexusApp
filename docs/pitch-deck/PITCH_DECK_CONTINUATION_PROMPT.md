# Sirsi Pitch Deck Elevation - Continuation Prompt
**Session Date:** February 17, 2026
**Status:** Phase 7 (Infrastructure) Structurally Complete; Resolution Mastery Pending.

---

## 🎯 Current Objective
**Finalize the "Keynote Elevation" of the Sirsi Nexus Pitch Deck, specifically mastering the 8K asset for Slide 8 and transitioning to the Financial Projections (Slide 13) and Unit Economics (Slide 12).**

## 📐 Slide 8: The SX-SUPER-CORE Master (LOCKED)
The structure and technical narrative for Slide 8 are canonized. **DO NOT CHANGE THE LAYOUT.**

### 1. **The Infrastructure Data Sheet**
- **Layout**: Two-column Apple Keynote split.
- **Left**: `assets/supercluster_mesh_8k.png` (High-fidelity SX-SUPER-CORE).
- **Right**: Technical Deep-Spec "filled to the gills".
- **Canonical Metrics**:
  - **16.0 TB RAM** (Calculated as 512GB Unified x 32-node mesh).
  - **4,000+ Cores** (CPU/GPU/Neural Density).
  - **256 TB Storage Swarm** (Sovereign NVMe).
  - **RDMA over TB5** (120 Gbps Sync).
  - **aBFT Trust Tier** (Hedera DLT Mirroring).

### 2. **Blocker: Resolution Mastery**
- The current asset `assets/supercluster_mesh_8k.png` is functionally 640p due to tool generation constraints in the previous session.
- **IMMEDIATE ACTION**: Re-render this EXACT composition (Two racks, 16 Studios each, central Sirsi Box, gold-braided cable) at **8192x8192** (or the maximum possible resolution without the 503 capacity error).
- **Goal**: Razor-sharp clarity for a professional tech photo portfolio.

## 🚀 Next Steps (Phase 8: Financials)

- **Goal**: Make the Revenue vs EBITDA charts "Unicorn-Scale".
- **Actions**:

  - Add inflection point callouts (e.g., "Month 18: Cash Flow Positive").
  - Integrate comparable logos (e.g., Snowflake, Palantir) in the $1B valuation path.

### **2. Slide 12: By The Numbers**
- **Goal**: Re-verify the fundraising roadmap matches the current "Seed ask" logic.
- **Current Numbers**: $12.1M Seed, $28M Pre-Money, 3 Patents Pending.
