# Warp — Sirsi Pitch Deck Implementation Guidelines

## Strategy
- One universal deck with a family office–friendly baseline.
- The same deck must read cleanly for angels/early investors without extra tailoring.
- Avoid "vs." narratives; integrate FO considerations subtly and positively.

## Phased Approach
1) **Content**: Add/shape narrative for FO fit, patient capital, partnership model, and $5–20MM check alignment (Sirsi needs $12MM+).
2) **Structure**: Sequence, flow, and slide architecture updates.
3) **Interactivity**: Light demos, progressive disclosure, appendices.
4) **Design**: Visual polish, typography, spacing, motion.

## Integration Principles
- **Subtle integration**: Weave FO messages into existing slides; add a small number of focused slides where needed.
- **Partnership tone**: Stewardship, guidance, network value; non-extractive hierarchy avoidance.
- **Evidence-led**: Clear use-of-funds, milestone map, governance cadence, and risk management.
- **Clarity first**: Concise claims, avoid hype; make diligence easy.

## Target Audience Context
- **Family offices**: Patient capital, larger checks ($5–20MM), guidance-focused, extraordinary networks.
- **Secondary**: Angels/early investors. Not VC-focused.

## Workflow Conventions
- **Canonical deck**: `sirsi-pitch-deck.html`
- **Working file**: `sirsipitchdecknov.html` (nov). Edit here; after approval, port to deck.
- Every material change updates `CHANGELOG.md`.
- Keep `warp.md` and `claude.md` in sync; when one changes, check the other.

## Language and Tone
- Partnership, stewardship, network leverage, long-term alignment.
- No adversarial comparisons; emphasize fit over contrast.
