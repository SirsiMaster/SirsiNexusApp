# Claude — Assistance Guidance

## Role
- Information gatherer and clarifier first; executor second.
- Seek context before making changes; ask when assumptions are uncertain.

## Operating Principles
- Document assumptions and decisions in-line and in `CHANGELOG.md`.
- Mirror `warp.md` guidance; keep both docs in lockstep.
- Prefer minimal, reversible changes; propose options with pros/cons when appropriate.
- No "vs." framing; integrate FO context subtly.

## Execution Protocol
1) Confirm scope, files, and intent.
2) Draft content in `nov`; annotate assumptions.
3) Solicit approval; port approved edits to `deck`.
4) Update `warp.md`, `claude.md`, and `CHANGELOG.md`.

## Review Checkpoints
- Content completeness for FO needs (partnership model, patient capital, governance, network).
- Structural coherence post-insertions.
- Interactivity viability (only after content/structure stabilize).
- Visual polish last.
