---

### 📋 **MEMORANDUM**

| | |
|:---|:---|
| **TO:** | Mr. Katrel Ortiz, Chief Operating Officer<br/>Boys & Girls Club of Paterson and Passaic<br/>📞 973.279.3055 ext. 333<br/>📱 347.210.8429<br/>✉️ KOrtiz@bgcppnj.org |
| **FROM:** | Mr. Cylton Collymore<br/>Senior Technical Advisor<br/>ThinkTJT Consulting Services<br/>📞 202-747-4787<br/>✉️ cylton@thinktjt.com |
| **DATE:** | September 16, 2025 |
| **RE:** | **Cost-Effective Alternative to Traditional Network Infrastructure Proposal** |

---

## 🎯 **Executive Summary**

Dear Mr. Ortiz,

After reviewing the network upgrade proposal from Atlantic Network Technologies dated September 15, 2025, I am writing to present a modern, cloud-first alternative that could save your organization approximately **$50,000-70,000** over five years while providing superior flexibility, security, and scalability.

The traditional proposal recommends $50,000-75,000 in hardware investments for firewalls, switches, and servers. However, modern ISP business services and cloud solutions can deliver everything your organization needs at a fraction of the cost, with no capital expenditure and significantly reduced complexity.

> ### 💡 **Key Recommendation**
> Partner with a business ISP for managed network services and migrate to Microsoft 365 or Google Workspace for Education, eliminating the need for on-premises servers and complex networking equipment.

### **Quick Win Summary:**

| Metric | Traditional Approach | Cloud-First Solution | **Your Savings** |
|:-------|:-------------------:|:-------------------:|:----------------:|
| **Initial Investment** | $50,000-75,000 | $8,000-15,000 | **$42,000-60,000** |
| **5-Year TCO** | $240,000-285,000 | $145,000 | **$95,000-140,000** |
| **Setup Time** | 3-6 months | 4-6 weeks | **2-5 months faster** |
| **IT Staff Required** | Full-time | Minimal | **Save 1 FTE** |
