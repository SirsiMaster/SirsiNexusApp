    a work made for hire under applicable law, Provider hereby irrevocably

    of Client’s source code) prior to integration and obtain Client’s
    approval.</p>
  <h3 id="ai-generated-content">5.4 AI-Generated Content</h3>
  <p>The Parties acknowledge that Provider utilizes advanced Artificial
    Intelligence tools (e.g., Google Gemini, Anthropic Claude) to assist in
    code generation and architecture. Provider warrants that it has the full
    legal right to assign ownership of such AI-generated output to Client as
    part of the Deliverables, and that such use does not violate the terms
    of service of the AI providers.</p>
  <h3 id="further-assurances">5.5 Further Assurances</h3>
  <p>Provider agrees to execute any documents and take any actions
    reasonably requested by Client to perfect Client’s ownership of the

    divulge any such Confidential Information to any third party (other than
    employees, contractors, or agents who have a need to know and are bound
    by written confidentiality obligations); and (iii) not to use such
    Confidential Information except for the performance of this
    Agreement.</p>

    Agreement; (b) was in the Receiving Party’s possession prior to
    disclosure without legal restriction; (c) is captured by the Receiving
    Party from a third party who had the legal right to disclose it; or (d)
