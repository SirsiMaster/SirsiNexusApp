echo "Problem Description:"
echo "===================="
echo "- The production deployment script was hanging at 'INFO: Running core system tests...'"
echo "- No way to stop the process with Ctrl+C"
echo "- System would hang indefinitely"
echo "- Root cause: timeout command not working properly + no signal handling"
echo ""

echo "Solution Implemented:"
echo "===================="
echo "1. ✅ Proper signal handling with SIGTERM → SIGKILL escalation"
echo "2. ✅ Custom timeout mechanism that works reliably on macOS"
echo "3. ✅ Progress monitoring with 30-second updates"
echo "4. ✅ Detailed error logging and debugging output"
echo "5. ✅ Graceful cleanup of test processes"
echo "6. ✅ Standalone test runner for easier debugging"

echo "- ✅ No more hanging processes"

echo "- ✅ Detailed test logs for debugging"

echo "Usage:"
echo "  ./scripts/test-runner.sh unit [timeout]     - Run unit tests"
echo "  ./scripts/test-runner.sh status             - Check running tests"
echo "  ./scripts/test-runner.sh kill               - Kill all test processes"
echo "  ./scripts/production-deployment.sh test     - Run deployment tests"
echo ""
echo "The production deployment script now includes:"
echo "- Robust test execution with 90-second timeout"
echo "- Signal handling for graceful termination"
echo "- Progress monitoring and error reporting"
echo "- Automatic cleanup of hanging processes"
