## Integration Workflow

### Migration Plan Step Enhancement

The migration plan step now requires completion of these prerequisites before proceeding:

1. **User Agreement Approval**: All required agreements must be acknowledged
2. **Security Protocol Validation**: All security protocols must be active and validated
3. **Asset Catalog Review**: Discovered assets must be reviewed and validated

### Audit Trail Integration

Every user action and system event is now logged with comprehensive details:

```typescript
const auditEvent = {
  id: `evt-${Date.now()}`,
  timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
  eventType: 'migration',
  action: 'user_agreement_approved',
  resourceType: 'migration_plan',
  userId: 'user-001',
  userName: 'john.doe@company.com',
  success: true,
  details: { agreementStatus: 'approved' }
};
```

## Usage Instructions

### 1. Starting the Enhanced Migration Workflow

1. Navigate to `/migration` in the SirsiNexus UI
2. Proceed through the Environment Setup step
3. Enter the enhanced Plan step with new components

### 2. User Agreement Process

1. Review each agreement category (security, compliance, process, risk)
2. Click "Details" to expand agreement information
3. Check the "Agree" checkbox for each required agreement
4. Required agreements must be completed before proceeding
5. Click "Proceed with Migration" when all requirements are met

### 3. Security Protocol Validation

1. Review the Security Protocol Status panel
2. Verify all protocols show "Active" status
3. Click on individual protocols to view detailed information
4. Use "Refresh" to update protocol status if needed
5. Ensure overall security status shows "All Security Protocols Active"

### 4. Asset Catalog Review

1. Browse the Discovered Assets Catalog
2. Use search and filters to find specific assets
3. Click on assets to view detailed metadata
4. Verify migration readiness status for each asset
5. Export the catalog if needed for external review

### 5. Audit Trail Monitoring

1. Monitor real-time audit events in the Migration Audit Trail
2. Use filters to focus on specific event types or users
3. Click on events to view detailed information
4. Export audit logs for compliance or analysis purposes

## Configuration Options

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Security Protocol Configuration
SECURITY_PROTOCOLS_ENABLED=true
MTLS_ENABLED=true
HTTPS_ENFORCED=true
SPIFFE_ENABLED=true
VAULT_ENABLED=true

# Audit Logging Configuration
AUDIT_LOGGING_ENABLED=true
AUDIT_LOG_LEVEL=info
AUDIT_EXPORT_FORMAT=json

# Migration Workflow Configuration
MIGRATION_AGREEMENTS_REQUIRED=true
SECURITY_VALIDATION_REQUIRED=true
ASSET_CATALOG_REQUIRED=true
```

### Backend Configuration

Update your Rust configuration to enable enhanced audit logging:

```rust
// In your main.rs or configuration module
let audit_logger = AuditLogger::new(pool.clone());
audit_logger.enable();

// Log migration-specific events
audit_logger.log_success(
    "migration",
    "migration_plan",
    Some("plan-123"),
    "migration_plan_approved",
    serde_json::json!({
        "user_agreements": true,
        "security_validated": true,
        "assets_cataloged": true
    }),
    audit_context,
).await?;
```

## Security Considerations

### 1. Protocol Enforcement

- ✅ mTLS for all inter-service communication
- ✅ HTTPS for all web traffic
- ✅ SSH/SFTP for secure file transfers
- ✅ SPIFFE/SPIRE for service identity
- ✅ Vault for secrets management

### 2. Audit Compliance

- ✅ All user actions are logged with full context
- ✅ IP addresses and user agents are captured
- ✅ Session tracking for correlation
- ✅ Success/failure status for all operations
- ✅ Detailed error messages for troubleshooting

### 3. Data Protection

- ✅ Sensitive data is not logged in plaintext
- ✅ User consent is required for data processing
- ✅ Audit logs can be exported for compliance
- ✅ Access controls on audit data

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **User Agreement Not Proceeding**
   - Verify all required agreements are checked
   - Check browser console for JavaScript errors
   - Ensure backend audit logging is working

2. **Security Protocols Showing Inactive**
   - Check service configurations for mTLS, HTTPS, etc.
   - Verify certificates are valid and not expired
   - Check network connectivity to security services

3. **Asset Catalog Not Loading**
   - Verify discovery services are running
   - Check permissions for asset enumeration
   - Review backend logs for discovery errors

4. **Audit Events Not Appearing**
   - Check audit logging configuration
   - Verify database connectivity
   - Ensure proper permissions for audit table access

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Check frontend build
cd /Users/thekryptodragon/SirsiNexus/ui
npm run build

# Check backend compilation
cd /Users/thekryptodragon/SirsiNexus/core-engine
cargo build

# Test audit logging
cargo test audit_logging

# Verify security protocols
cargo test security_protocols
```

## Performance Considerations

- Components use React.memo for optimization
- Audit events are batched for database efficiency
- Security protocol checks are cached with TTL
- Asset discovery is paginated for large environments

## API Integration

### Frontend to Backend Communication

The enhanced migration workflow communicates with the backend through:

1. **User Agreement Events**: Posted to `/api/audit/events`
2. **Security Protocol Status**: Fetched from `/api/security/protocols`
3. **Asset Discovery**: Retrieved from `/api/migration/assets`
4. **Audit Log Export**: Downloaded from `/api/audit/export`

### Backend Event Processing

```rust
// Example audit event processing
#[post("/audit/events")]
async fn log_audit_event(
    event: Json<AuditEventRequest>,
    audit_logger: Data<AuditLogger>,
) -> Result<HttpResponse> {
    let context = AuditContext {
        user_id: event.user_id,
        session_id: event.session_id,
        ip_address: event.ip_address,
        user_agent: event.user_agent,
    };

    audit_logger.log_success(
        &event.event_type,
        &event.resource_type,
        event.resource_id.as_deref(),
        &event.action,
        event.details.clone(),
        context,
    ).await?;

    Ok(HttpResponse::Ok().json(serde_json::json!({
        "success": true,
        "event_id": event.id
    })))
}
```
