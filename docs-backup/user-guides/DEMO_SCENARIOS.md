# Sirsi Nexus Demo Scenarios

### Overall Goal

Demonstrate the capabilities of Sirsi Nexus platform in a guided demonstration with three synthetic scenarios:
1. Migration
2. Optimization
3. Scale-Up

## 1. Migration Demo

**Objective**: Showcase a migration from one cloud environment to another using Sirsi Nexus capabilities.

**Key Features**:
- **Resource Discovery**: Demonstrate discovery of resources in current environment.
- **Initial Cost Analysis**: Present a detailed cost analysis of the current setup.
- **AI-Driven Recommendations**: Show insights and recommendations for a smooth migration.

**Synthetic Setup**:
- Use a mock setup representing a typical cloud environment.
- Inputs: Cloud resource configurations, cost metrics.

**Expected Output**:
- Resource discovery list with attributes.
- Migration plan with cost analysis and recommendations.

## 2. Optimization Demo

**Objective**: Illustrate real-time cost optimization and resource right-sizing using synthetic data.

**Key Features**:
- **Cost Optimization**: Real-time suggestions for optimizing costs.
- **Resource Right-Sizing**: Recommendations to match system demands.

**Synthetic Setup**:
- Mock resources with inefficiencies.
- Inputs: Usage metrics, cost data.

**Expected Output**:
- Optimization report with specific actionable recommendations.

## 3. Scale-Up Demo

**Objective**: Simulate a scale-up scenario with predictive scaling capability.

**Key Features**:
- **Predictive Scaling**: Automated scale-up based on demand forecast.
- **Cost Implications**: Analyze the cost impact of scaling operations.

**Synthetic Setup**:
- Simulate increased load conditions.
- Inputs: Load metrics, resource capabilities.

**Expected Output**:
- Scaling recommendations with detailed cost analysis.
