## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks:
1. **Agent Communication Complexity**: Implement robust error handling and fallback mechanisms
2. **Performance Under Load**: Add agent pooling and load balancing
3. **WASM Runtime Issues**: Provide Go-based agent fallback option
4. **Context Store Scaling**: Implement Redis clustering from start

### Timeline Risks:
1. **Scope Creep**: Focus on MVP agent functionality first
2. **Integration Complexity**: Prioritize basic agent communication over advanced features
3. **Testing Overhead**: Implement continuous testing from day 1

## Next Phase Preview (Phase 3)

Following Phase 2 completion, Phase 3 will focus on:
- **Cloud Connectors**: Full AWS, Azure, GCP, vSphere integration
- **Resource Discovery**: Automated multi-cloud resource enumeration
- **Testcontainers Integration**: Comprehensive testing with cloud provider mocks
- **Advanced Agent Orchestration**: Complex multi-agent workflows

## Conclusion

Phase 2 represents a critical milestone in achieving full CDB compliance and establishing the foundation for our AI-powered agent ecosystem. Success in this phase will enable all subsequent phases and bring us to 95% CDB compliance, positioning us for production-ready deployment.

**Key Focus Areas:**
1. Robust agent communication infrastructure
2. Production-ready gRPC service implementation  
3. Real-time UI integration with live agents
4. Comprehensive testing and monitoring

This implementation plan aligns with the CDB requirements and provides a clear roadmap for the next 4-6 weeks of development.
