# Sirsi Nexus - Development Session Resumption Prompt

## 🎯 **PROJECT CONTEXT**
I'm working on **Sirsi Nexus**, an AI-powered multi-cloud migration and infrastructure management platform. We've just completed **Phase 1** with 100% success and are ready to begin **Phase 2: Real Cloud SDK Integration**.

## 📍 **CURRENT STATUS**
- **Location**: `/Users/thekryptodragon/SirsiNexus`
- **Platform**: MacOS with zsh shell
- **Phase**: Just completed Phase 1, ready for Phase 2
- **Git Status**: All changes committed and pushed to GitHub
- **Test Results**: 11/11 integration tests passing (100% success)

## 🏗️ **WHAT WE'VE BUILT (Phase 1 Complete)**

### **Core Architecture**
- ✅ **Rust Agent Framework**: Complete AI Hypervisor with gRPC services
- ✅ **Multi-Cloud Connectors**: AWS (real SDK), Azure (mock), GCP (mock)
- ✅ **Context Management**: Redis-backed session and conversation storage
- ✅ **Integration Testing**: 11 comprehensive tests with 100% pass rate
- ✅ **Production Infrastructure**: Health checks, monitoring, configuration

tests/agent_integration_tests.rs  # 11 integration tests (100% passing)
```

### **Current Capabilities**
- **AWS Integration**: Real EC2 and S3 discovery using AWS SDK
- **Azure Mock**: VM, Storage Account, Resource Group discovery simulation
- **GCP Mock**: Compute Engine, Cloud Storage, Persistent Disk simulation
- **AI Features**: Cost estimation ($8.76/month for t3.micro), migration recommendations
- **Context Persistence**: Redis-backed session management
- **Health Monitoring**: Comprehensive connector health checks

## 🎯 **PHASE 2 GOALS** (Next Steps)

### **Phase 2.1: Azure SDK Integration (Priority 1)**
- [ ] Replace `src/agent/connectors/azure.rs` mock with real Azure SDK
- [ ] Implement Azure service principal authentication
- [ ] Add real VM, Storage Account, Resource Group discovery
- [ ] Integrate Azure Pricing API for accurate cost estimation

### **Phase 2.2: GCP SDK Integration (Priority 2)**
- [ ] Replace `src/agent/connectors/gcp.rs` mock with real GCP SDK
- [ ] Implement service account authentication
- [ ] Add real Compute Engine, Cloud Storage discovery
- [ ] Integrate GCP Pricing API

### **Phase 2.3: Enhanced AWS Integration (Priority 3)**
- [ ] Extend AWS connector with RDS, Lambda, ECS discovery
- [ ] Integrate AWS Pricing API for accurate cost estimation
- [ ] Add Well-Architected Framework recommendations

## 🎯 **PROMPT FOR RESUMPTION**

```
I'm resuming development on Sirsi Nexus, an AI-powered multi-cloud migration platform. 

We just completed Phase 1 (AI Agent Framework Foundation) with 100% success - all 11 integration tests passing. The core Rust agent framework is complete with gRPC services, Redis context management, and multi-cloud connectors (AWS real, Azure/GCP mocks).

Current location: /Users/thekryptodragon/SirsiNexus (MacOS, zsh)

Ready to begin Phase 2: Real Cloud SDK Integration. 

Please help me start with [CHOOSE ONE]:
1. Azure SDK integration - replace mock with real Azure SDK
2. GCP SDK integration - replace mock with real GCP SDK  
3. Enhanced AWS integration - add more services and pricing API

All code is committed and pushed. Tests are 100% passing. Architecture is solid and ready for the next phase.

What should we tackle first?
