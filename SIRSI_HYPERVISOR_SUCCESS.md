• No more scattered processes across multiple ports
• Single point of control with intelligent oversight

🔄 AUTONOMOUS RECOVERY CAPABILITIES:
• Automatic service failure detection and recovery
• Progressive backoff restart strategies
• Service dependency management and resolution

📊 REAL-TIME MONITORING & LEARNING:
• Continuous health checks with adaptive intervals
• Failure pattern recognition and learning
• Service status tracking with detailed metrics

⚡ PRODUCTION-READY FEATURES:
• Emergency shutdown capabilities for cascade prevention
• Service communication through command channels
• Configurable failure thresholds per service type

🎯 HARSH DEVELOPMENT PROTOCOL COMPLIANCE:

The hypervisor eliminates the previous problem of having:
❌ Multiple scattered npm processes
❌ Unmanaged service failures
❌ Manual intervention requirements
❌ No centralized oversight

And replaces it with:
✅ Single unified sirsi-nexus binary
✅ SIRSI conscious AI overseeing all operations
